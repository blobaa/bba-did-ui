# bba-did-ui

The source code for [WUBCO](https://wubco.blobaa.dev).

This repository contains the source code for the **W**eb **U**I for **B**BA **C**RUD **O**perations website. It wraps the [bba DID method handler](https://github.com/blobaa/bba-did-method-handler-ts) to provide a human friendly access to the [bba DID method](https://github.com/blobaa/bba-did-method-specification).

Use the `.env-sample` file as template.


## Usage


### Development

run server for development:

````
npm run dev
````

The website is now accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

In dev environment mode (`RUN_ENV=dev`) no request is made to an Ardor node and a dummy DID is used wich is stored within the `./src/dev.ts` file. This mode is primarly used for UI development. If you want to use the website locally to process bba's DID method operations, set the RUN_ENV variable to prod `RUN_ENV=prod`.


### Production

There are two options to deploy WUBCO.


#### Self Hosted

Creating a static website which can be served by any static web server.

Lint project:

````
npm run lint
````


Build project:

````
npm run build
````


Create static website:

````
npm run export
````


WUBCO is now available within the `./out` folder.


#### GitHub Pages

There is an easy way to serve WUBCO with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). Follow the steps below to set up GitHub Pages to serve WUBCO from within this repository (source repository).

1. Create a separate repository (target repository) and configure GitHub Pages to serve files from the root folder of the master branch of the target repository.
2. Create a `.env-production` file within the source repository and configure your production environment settings.
3. [Authorize SSH access](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) to the target repository from the system containing your source repository.

You can now deploy WUBCO with the following commands:

````
cd scripts
./deploy-frontend.sh -u <github user> -r <repository name> -d <domain>
````

Replace `<github user>` with your GitHub user name and `<repository name>` with the target repository name. Replace `<domain>` if you serve WUBCO under a custom domain. Otherwise do not use this option.
